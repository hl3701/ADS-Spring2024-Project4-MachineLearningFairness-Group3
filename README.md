**Contribution statement**: 

We use both airness Constraints: Mechanisms for Fair Classification Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment to find out the unfair impact from race and gender. Finally, we remove the negative impact and gain the result.

Zhengfei Chen conduct the data filtering & cleaning and feature selection work initially. 

For the Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment, Hongxu Lin and Zhengfei Chen did this algorithm. Zhengfei Chen and Hongxu Lin discussed the ideas" Zhengfei Chen wrote the part of model conduction part, and Hongxu Lin took charge in accuracy plotting and revision of algorithm work.

For the Fairness Constraints: Mechanisms for Fair Classification: Yanzhao Chen Completed the entire A1 code part alone, and explained the A1 code with the presenter. Lei Bao added the result interpretation in the code.
